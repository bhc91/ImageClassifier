- Adjustable inference settings (confidence threshold, max results, number of threads)
- User-friendly bottom sheet for settings

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/bhc91/ImageClassifier.git
    ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the app on an Android device or emulator.

## Usage

- Launch the app and grant necessary permissions.
- Use the camera to capture images for classification.
- Adjust inference settings using the bottom sheet.
